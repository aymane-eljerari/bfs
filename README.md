# Breadth-First Search Using CUDA

Breadth-first search (BFS) is an algorithm for searching a tree data structure for a node that satisfies a given property. It starts at the tree root and explores all nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to the nodes at the next depth level. Extra memory, usually a queue, is needed to keep track of the child nodes that were encountered but not yet explored.

This project analyzes three implementations of breadth-first search:

1. Serial version
2. Multi-threaded version
3. CUDA version

### Prerequisites

C language
GPUs
[add more]

### Instructions

To run the experiment, compile and execute using the following terminal commands.

```
make
./bfs
```

To run the cuda version, use the following commands
First, find your GPU model:
```
nvidia-smi
```
The output in this case:

Next, load the compiler for your GPU compiler:
```
module load cuda
```
([cuda] was dependent on the type of GPU being used in this case)

Finally, to compile CUDA program:
```
nvcc -arch sm_35 bfs_cuda.cu -o bfs_cuda
```
