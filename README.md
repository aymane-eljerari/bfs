# Breadth-First Search Using CUDA

Breadth-first search (BFS) is an algorithm for searching a tree data structure for a node that satisfies a given property. It starts at the tree root and explores all nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to the nodes at the next depth level. Extra memory, usually a queue, is needed to keep track of the child nodes that were encountered but not yet explored.

This project analyzes three implementations of breadth-first search:

1. Serial version
2. Multi-threaded version
3. CUDA version

### Prerequisites

C language
GPUs
[add more]

### Instructions

To run the experiment, compile and execute using the following terminal commands.

```
make
./bfs
```


## Project Overview

Sample adjacency list output with 10 vertices and a maximum degree of 3.
